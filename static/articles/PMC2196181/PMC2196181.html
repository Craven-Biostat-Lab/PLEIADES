                  <p class="first" id="d1e177">Genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrated that Eps8 is involved in the routing
                     of signals from Ras to Rac. This is achieved through the formation of a tricomplex
                     consisting of Eps8–E3b1–Sos-1, which is endowed with Rac guanine nucleotide exchange
                     activity. The catalytic subunit of this complex is represented by Sos-1, a bifunctional
                     molecule capable of catalyzing guanine nucleotide exchange on Ras and Rac. The mechanism
                     by which Sos-1 activity is specifically directed toward Rac remains to be established.
                     Here, by performing a structure–function analysis we show that the Eps8 output function
                     resides in an effector region located within its COOH terminus. This effector region,
                     when separated from the holoprotein, activates Rac and acts as a potent inducer of
                     actin polymerization. In addition, it binds to Sos-1 and is able to induce Rac-specific,
                     Sos-1–dependent guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Finally, the Eps8 effector region
                     mediates a direct interaction of Eps8 with F-actin, dictating Eps8 cellular localization.
                     We propose a model whereby the engagement of Eps8 in a tricomplex with E3b1 and Sos-1
                     facilitates the interaction of Eps8 with Sos-1 and the consequent activation of an
                     Sos-1 Rac–specific catalytic ability. In this complex, determinants of Eps8 are responsible
                     for the proper localization of the Rac-activating machine to sites of actin remodeling.

               of small GTPases. The activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), resulting in
               the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, is one of the best characterized pathways
               controlled by these molecular switches. Active ligand–engaged RTKs signal to a critical
               small GTPase, Ras, which in turn activates another small GTPase, Rac. Finally, active
               GTP–bound Rac is directly responsible for molecular events leading to actin remodeling
               (for review see <a href="#bib2">Bar-Sagi and Hall, 2000</a>; <a href="#bib32">Scita et al., 2000</a>).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e205">The molecular mechanisms of this cascade are being elucidated. Biochemical and genetic
               studies have shown how the Son of Sevenless (Sos)-1 GEF transduces the signal from
               active RTKs to Ras (for review see <a href="#bib1">Bar-Sagi, 1994</a>; <a href="#bib29">Schlessinger, 2000</a>). Sos-1 interacts with the SH3-containing adaptor molecule Grb2. Grb2 in turn displays
               an SH2 domain responsible for the recruitment of the Grb2–Sos-1 complex to active,
               autophosphorylated RTKs. The relocalization of the complex to the plasma membrane
               is thought to be sufficient for Sos-1 to catalyze the exchange of guanine nucleotides
               on Ras, which is also present at the plasma membrane.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e213">How Ras signals to Rac is less understood. Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3-K) binds
               directly to Ras-GTP and it is required for activation of Rac (for review see <a href="#bib26">Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1997</a>). In hematopoietic cells, the product of PI3-K's catalytic activity, phosphatidylinositol
               3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3), contributes through direct binding to the activation of
               a Rac-specific GEF, Vav-1 (<a href="#bib10">Han et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#bib4">Das et al., 2000</a>). In nonhematopoietic cells, the lack of expression of Vav-1 indicates that other
               GEFs must be involved. Indeed, two recently identified members of the Vav family,
               Vav2 and Vav3, display ubiquitous expression and have been implicated in RTK-mediated
               actin remodelling (<a href="#bib30">Schuebel et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#bib13">Liu and Burridge, 2000</a>; <a href="#bib19">Moores et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib34">Trenkle et al., 2000</a>).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e237">Sos-1 was also implicated in Ras-to-Rac signaling (<a href="#bib21">Nimnual et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#bib31">Scita et al., 1999</a>). Sos-1 was shown to participate in vivo in a tricomplex with two signaling molecules,
               Eps8 (<a href="#bib8">Fazioli et al., 1993</a>) and E3b1 (also known as Abi-1) (<a href="#bib33">Shi et al., 1995</a>; <a href="#bib3">Biesova et al., 1997</a>). E3b1 contains an SH3 domain that mediates its binding to Sos-1 (<a href="#bib31">Scita et al., 1999</a>; <a href="#bib7">Fan and Goff, 2000</a>). In addition, E3b1 binds to the SH3 domain of Eps8, thus acting as a scaffold protein
               which holds together Sos-1 and Eps8 (<a href="#bib3">Biesova et al., 1997</a>; <a href="#bib18">Mongiovi et al., 1999</a>; <a href="#bib31">Scita et al., 1999</a>). The tricomplex Sos-1–E3b1–Eps8 displays Rac GEF activity in vitro (<a href="#bib31">Scita et al., 1999</a>). Therefore, Sos-1 might be endowed with a dual GEF activity, for Ras and Rac, respectively.
               At the molecular level, this is mirrored by the presence of two GEF domains in Sos-1:
               (a) a Cdc25-like domain, responsible for activity on Ras, and (b) a DH-PH tandem domain,
               a hallmark of GEFs for Rho GTPases, the subfamily to which Rac belongs. However, purified
               Sos-1 does not display Rac-GEF activity, whereas Ras-GEF activity could be readily
               detected. Thus, a coherent picture of how Sos-1 regulates Rac activation is still
               missing. Another unresolved question concerns the mechanism responsible for the proper
               compartmentalization of Sos-1 to sites where the Rac-based actin polymerizing machinery
               needs to be active. In this study, we provide evidence that Eps8 is a critical factor
               in the regulation of both these functions.

                  of Eps8 fused to the green fluorescence protein (GFP). A GFP full length Eps8 (amino
                  acids 1–821) displayed a sub-cellular localization indistinguishable from that of
                  the endogenous protein (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> B). In contrast, a NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–535) showed a diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear staining
                  unaltered by treatment with growth factors, suggesting that the COOH terminus contains
                  residues important for Eps8 localization (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> B). Accordingly, a COOH-terminal fragment (amino acids 535–821) displayed intense
                  localization along the cell cortex within structures reminiscent of ruffles. These
                  structures corresponded to sites of actin polymerization (not shown; see also <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>)
                  
                  . The differential cellular localization of the Eps8 mutants was not due to the GFP
                  moiety, since GFP alone was diffusely distributed in the nucleus and the cytoplasm
                  (not shown). Furthermore, similar levels of expression of the various Eps8 constructs

               <p id="d1e342">An unexpected finding emerged from the studies with the Eps8 (535–821) mutant. In
                  serum-starved mouse embryo fibroblasts, where the actin cytoskeleton is organized
                  in a flat array of stress fibers, the expression of this mutant caused reorganization
                  of F-actin into dorsal and membrane ruffles (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a> B). This effect could also be observed in different cell lines (Cos-7, NIH-3T3, HeLa;
                  not shown). Thus, the COOH terminus of Eps8 is responsible not only for proper localization
                  of the protein, but it also displays an “effector” function, capable of inducing actin
                  cytoskeleton remodeling in the absence of growth factor stimulation.

               <p id="d1e350">We engineered a series of deletion mutants of Eps8 (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a> A) fused to GFP. A mutant, 586–821, lacking the SH3 domain retained ruffling activity
                  in the absence of growth factor treatment (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</a>), indicating that the SH3 domain of Eps8 is dispensable for actin reorganization
                  activity in the absence of growth factors. Thus, an interaction with E3b1, mediated
                  by the SH3 domain of Eps8, is not required for the effector function of the COOH-terminal
                  fragment of Eps8.

               <p id="d1e358">Further deletions of the COOH terminus of Eps8 (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</a>) showed that the minimal region required to elicit ruffling spanned amino acids 648–821.
                  Interestingly, this region is also the minimal region required for colocalization
                  with polymerized actin (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a> A). Indeed, for all the Eps8 mutants containing this region, there was perfect correlation
                  between ruffling activity and colocalization with phalloidin-stained F-actin (or lack
                  of both events; <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a> A). Notably, the Eps8 effector region, similarly to the known inducer of actin polymerization
                  such as activated Rac and PI3-K, induces prominent peripheral ruffles, but only rarely
                  circular ruffles. These latter structures are dependent on PDGF stimulation, pointing
                  to the requirement of additional signaling events, whose nature remains undetermined.

                  structures along the dorsal area and the leading edge of cells, thus confirming the
                  observations obtained in paraformaldehyde-fixed cells. Furthermore, it relocalized
                  in protruding lamellipodia of spreading and moving cells, suggesting its involvement
                  in migratory processes (supplementary information). Thus, Eps8 is endowed with a potent
                  and constitutive ruffle-inducing activity residing in its 173 COOH-terminal amino

               <p id="d1e505">To test this possibility, we first mapped the region of Eps8 that binds to Sos-1.
                  Native Sos-1 could be specifically recovered onto GST-fused Eps8 COOH-terminal fragments.
                  The minimal region capable of interacting with Sos-1 extended from amino acids 648
                  to 821, thus coinciding with the region required for the biological activity of the
                  effector domain (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7, A and B</a>). The interaction was likely direct, since GST-Eps8 (648–821) was able to bind, albeit
                  with low stoichiometry, to native, eukaryotically produced, and purified (&gt;90% purity)
                  Sos-1 (<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a> C). However, it cannot be formally excluded that copurified proteins tightly associated
                  to Sos-1 might be responsible for the observed interaction.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e513">As shown in <a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a> B, the effector region of Eps8, when alone, bound to purified Sos-1 at least 10-fold
                  better than full length GST-Eps8. The marginal binding of full length GST-Eps8 might
                  reflect the true ability of the holoprotein to interact with Sos-1 or an artifactual
                  situation. Under this latter scenario, one could postulate that in vivo Eps8 does
                  not bind to Sos-1 unless determinants in its COOH terminus are unmasked: a setting
                  mimicked by the enucleation of the effector region from the holoprotein, or by partial
                  unfolding of the bacterially expressed Eps8 full length molecule. To gain insight
                  into this issue we studied the association in vivo of Sos-1 with either the effector
                  region of Eps8 or with the holoprotein. Native Sos-1 could be efficiently recovered
                  in HA-tagged Eps8 (586–821) immunoprecipitates of cells double transfected with Sos-1
                  and HA-Eps8 (586–821) (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a> C). No E3b1 could be detected in the same immunoprecipitates, even under conditions
                  of E3b1 overexpression (not shown). On the contrary, the in vivo association between
                  Sos-1 and Eps8 was strictly E3b1-dependent. Indeed, native Sos-1 could be readily
                  recovered in Eps8 immunoprecipitates from triple Sos-1–E3b1–Eps8 transfectants, but
                  not when an Eps8 mutant, unable to bind E3b1 due to a deletion in its SH3 domain (Eps8ΔSH3),
                  was used (Sos-1–Eps8ΔSH3–E3b1 transfectants), or when E3b1 was not transfected along
                  with Sos-1 and Eps8 (Sos-1–Eps8) (<a href="#bib31">Scita et al., 1999</a>; <a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a> C).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e527">We then tested whether the biological and biochemical activity of the Eps8 effector
                  region could activate Sos-1 Rac–specific GEF in vivo. First, a Rac-GEF assay was performed
                  using lysates of cells expressing the effector domain of Eps8 or a ruffling-incompetent
                  Eps8 fragment (586–733) which cannot bind to Sos-1. Expression of the effector region,
                  but not of the ruffling-incompetent fragment, induced a substantial increase in Rac-specific
                  GEF activity in vivo over the basal control values (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a> D). This effect was dependent on the presence of Sos-1 (or of another GEF, tightly
                  associated to Sos-1), since no Rac-GEF activity could be detected in the same lysates
                  upon immunodepletion of Sos-1 (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a> D). Second, we used in vitro assays that can score GEF activities in immunoprecipitates.
                  Cells were transfected either with a construct containing the effector region, Eps8
                  (586–821), or with a control construct, Eps8 (1–535), alone or in combination with
                  Sos-1. Rac-GEF activity could be readily detected when the Eps8 (586–821) protein
                  was immunoprecipitated from cells coexpressing Eps8 (586–821) and Sos-1 (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a> E). Under these conditions, coimmunoprecipitation between Eps8 (586–821) and Sos-1
                  was detected (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a> E, bottom). Thus, the Eps8 effector region participates in the regulation of a Rac-specific
                  GEF activity, which depends on the presence of Sos-1 or Sos-1–associated GEFs.

                  A, several cellular proteins were detected by silver staining. We concentrated our
                  attention on those bands that were recovered by the 586–821 fragment (which is biologically
                  active and properly localized), but not by the 733–821 or by the SH3 fragments (which
                  are biologically inactive and delocalized), and subjected them to MALDI mass spectrometry
                  and NanoElectrospray. Two proteins were unequivocally identified: actin and the myosin
                  II heavy chain (<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a> A). Both associations were confirmed by in vitro binding experiments (<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a> B). Of note, the low stoichiometry of interaction between Eps8 and myosin II heavy
                  chain suggested an indirect interaction, possibly mediated by actin. Therefore, we
                  characterized the Eps8/actin association.

                  GST fusion fragments of Eps8 were tested for in vitro binding to purified F-actin
                  and G-actin in a high speed cosedimentation and in a low speed centrifugation assay,
                  respectively (<a href="#bib16">Matsudaira, 1992</a>). A significant amount of GST-Eps8 (586–821) cosedimented with F-actin in a concentration-dependent
                  manner, whereas control GST (not shown) or GST-Eps8 (586–733) (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a> B) were unable to do so. Furthermore, no binding to monomeric G-actin could be detected
                  with any of the tested fusion proteins (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a> C, right). Notably, under the same conditions, efficient association between G-actin
                  and the COOH-terminal region of Scar2, a known G-actin binding surface (<a href="#bib17">Miki et al., 1998</a>), could be observed (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a> C). Thus, the effector region of Eps8 binds directly to F-actin. However, no actin-polymerizing
                  activity of the purified Eps8 effector region could be detected using a pyrene-conjugated
                  actin polymerization assay (Karlsson, R., and G. Scita, personal communication). Thus,
                  Eps8 might bind to F-actin in a manner similar to proteins like S-nexilin (<a href="#bib22">Ohtsuka et al., 1998</a>) or 1-afadin (<a href="#bib14">Mandai et al., 1997</a>), which are devoid of actin-bundling properties in vitro and serve as linkers between
                  the actin cytoskeleton and subdomains on the plasma membrane.

                  actin could be specifically coimmunoprecipitated with Eps8, whereas no association
                  could be observed when preimmune sera were used, or in Eps8 immunoprecipitates performed

            <p id="d1e656">We have shown previously that Eps8 is indispensable for the activation of the small
               GTPase Rac (<a href="#bib31">Scita et al., 1999</a>). This was mirrored by the detection in vivo of a tricomplex Eps8–E3b1–Sos-1, which
               was shown to display Rac-GEF activity in vitro (<a href="#bib31">Scita et al., 1999</a>). In this study, we provide evidence regarding the molecular mechanisms through which
               Eps8 affects the substrate specificity of Sos-1 and facilitates targeting of a Rac-activating
               complex to its proper subcellular sites. We identified a COOH-terminal region that
               is alone sufficient for both the actin-remodeling function and the localization to
               F-actin–containing structures of Eps8. We called this region the “effector region”
               of Eps8.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e664">Several lines of evidence indicate that the effector region of Eps8 functions as a
               constitutively active variant of Eps8. First, genetic data demonstrated that the mechanism
               whereby the Eps8 effector region induces ruffles requires the activation and proper
               localization of Rac. Moreover, the effector region of Eps8 did not require Ras/PI3-K
               or Cdc42 to induce actin remodeling. This is in agreement with our previous work,
               which epistatically positioned Eps8 between Ras/PI3-K and Rac (<a href="#bib31">Scita et al., 1999</a>). Biochemical evidence also supported a role of the Eps8 effector region in the activation
               of Rac. Its transient expression led to activation in vivo of Rac and PAK65. Moreover,
               the overexpression of the effector region of Eps8 increased the levels of Rac-specific
               GEF activities in the cell by a mechanism which was shown to be directly dependent
               on the presence of Sos-1 (or of Sos-1–associated GEFs) and on the interaction between
               Sos-1 and the Eps8 effector region.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e669">Thus, the effector region of Eps8 appears to signal in a manner indistinguishable
               from full length Eps8, albeit in a growth factor–independent fashion. Indeed, we showed
               that the overexpression of the effector region, but not of the full length Eps8 protein,
               is sufficient to elicit actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Thus, within the context of
               the full length Eps8 protein, a tight regulation of the effector function must be
               at play and determinants contained in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal half of Eps8 are predicted to exert an inhibitory role. This mode of action
               is remarkably reminiscent of that of Wasp and its homologue N-Wasp, which link multiple
               signaling pathways to actin assembly. N-Wasp interacts with the Arp2/3 complex and
               activates the ability of the latter to nucleate actin filaments (for review see <a href="#bib20">Mullins, 2000</a>). A COOH-terminal domain of N-Wasp, the VCA domain, is sufficient when enucleated
               from the full length molecule to bind to the Arp2/3 complex and activate it (<a href="#bib20">Mullins, 2000</a>). Physiologically, however, activation of N-Wasp occurs when the molecule is stimulated
               by the proper set of upstream signals, including active Cdc42 and PIP2. These molecules
               bind cooperatively to N-Wasp and force it to adopt an open conformation, which exposes
               the VCA domain, allowing its effector function (<a href="#bib27">Rohatgi et al., 1999</a>; <a href="#bib11">Higgs and Pollard, 2000</a>; <a href="#bib23">Prehoda et al., 2000</a>).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e690">In analogy to Wasp and N-Wasp, and based on our results, a model can therefore be
               proposed in which Eps8 that is normally inactive in the cell is activated by upstream
               signals and therefore rendered competent for activation of Rac. From our data, it
               appears that the key step in this series of events is the binding of the effector
               region of Eps8 to Sos-1. Indeed several activities, including Sos-1 binding, induction
               of Rac-specific GEFs and activation of Rac and Rac-dependent pathways, all cosegregated
               with the same fragment of Eps8. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that a latent, Rac-specific,
               GEF activity of Sos-1 is unmasked upon direct binding to the effector region of Eps8.
               In this scenario, the “activation” of Eps8 might correspond to a conformational change
               (or functionally equivalent mechanism), which renders its effector region available
               for direct interaction with Sos-1. A corollary of such a model is that full length
               Eps8 should not be able to bind to Sos-1 directly. Indeed, we show in this and previous
               studies (<a href="#bib31">Scita et al., 1999</a>) that association of Eps8 with Sos-1 is strictly dependent on the presence of the
               scaffolding molecule E3b1 (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7C</a>). On the contrary, this latter molecule is not required for the interaction between
               the effector region of Eps8 and Sos-1 (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>, A–C), which are readily coimmunoprecipitated in vivo. To validate this model, we
               are presently attempting to reconstitute in vitro a Rac-specific GEF complex by using
               purified E3b1–Sos-1–Eps8 or purified Sos-1–Eps8 effector region.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e701">Our model also provide clues as to how the Sos-1 Rac–specific GEF activity is regulated
               under physiological conditions, within the context of a trimeric complex where E3b1
               scaffolds together Eps8 and Sos-1. We note that the affinity of Sos-1 for the effector
               region of Eps8 is rather low. Thus, the scaffolding function of E3b1 might provide
               an efficient mechanism of increasing the local concentration of the two binders (Eps8
               and Sos-1) for the purpose of achieving a stoichiometry of interaction sufficient
               for biological output. Under conditions of overexpression of the effector region (but
               not of full length Eps8, according to our model), this requirement might be bypassed
               simply by virtue of mass action. Of course, this model does not exclude that other
               events, in addition to the simple Eps8–Sos-1 interaction, are required in vivo to
               activate the Rac-specific GEF function of Sos-1. One obvious level of regulation is
               the one exerted by growth factor stimulation, which might, among other effects, relieve
               the inhibition of Eps8. This could be achieved by a variety of mechanisms, including
               tyrosine phosphorylation of Eps8 or binding of phosphoinositides to the DH-PH domain
               of Sos-1 or to the PTB domain of Eps8. We are presently investigating these possibilities.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e703">An additional level of regulation is highlighted by our findings of a physical direct
               interaction between Eps8 and F-actin, which mirrored the in vivo colocalization of
               Eps8 with F-actin–containing structures. This function is also contained within the
               effector region of Eps8. We could not identify determinants within this region that
               would allow the dissection of the abilities to bind to F-actin or to Sos-1. This might
               be due to a high degree of overlap between the two surfaces. In this case, single
               amino acid mutations might be required to identify the residues responsible for each
               individual interaction. The effector region of Eps8 did not appear to be endowed with
               intrinsic actin-polymerizing activity. Thus, the most likely functional role of the
               Eps8–F-actin interaction is that of directing Eps8 to sites where actin remodeling
               has to occur in response to extracellular stimuli. E3b1 and Sos-1 are also localized
               to F-actin–containing structures after growth factor stimulation of intact cells,
               and therefore interaction of Eps8 with F-actin might dictate the relocalization of
               the Rac-activating trimeric complex Eps8–E3b1–Sos-1 to sites where its activity is
               required.
