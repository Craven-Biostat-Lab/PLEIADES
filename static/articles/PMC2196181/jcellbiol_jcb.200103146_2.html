Images were captured every 15 min with a coded CCD camera (Hamamatsu). GFP epifluorescence was detected with an FITC filter set (Chromo Technology). A set of six consecutive images captured at the indicated time is also shown. Arrows point to ruffles. Arrowheads point to spreading lamellipodia where the GFP-effector domain is relocalized.
